# BurgerLogger
---
This is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. The burger will be displayed in the left side of the page, waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the waiting area has a "Devour it!" button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page and be greyed out.

Every burger is stored in the database, whethere it's devoured or not.
